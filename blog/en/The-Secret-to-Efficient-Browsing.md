# The Secret to Efficient Browsing: How Link Hover Preview Technology Works

We all want **browsing faster without too many tabs**. The constant back-and-forth between pages breaks concentration and wastes time. But what's the secret weapon for truly efficient browsing? It often lies in **link hover preview** technology.

Instead of clicking every potentially interesting link, **link hover preview** lets you simply pause your cursor over it. A small window instantly appears, showing you the content of that linked page. Think of it as X-ray vision for hyperlinks!

How does it work? Generally, a **link preview extension** like NoTab cleverly fetches the essential content of the linked page in the background *without* fully loading it in a new tab. It then displays this content in an overlay.

This approach offers several benefits:
*   **Massive Time Savings:** Decide relevance in seconds, not minutes.
*   **Reduced Cognitive Load:** Stay focused on your primary task.
*   **Efficient Resource Use:** Avoids loading unnecessary resources, helping to **save memory by reducing open tabs**.
