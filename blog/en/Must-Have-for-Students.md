# Must-Have for Students: The Best Link Preview Extension for Efficient Research

Student life means research, and research often means drowning in browser tabs. Lecture notes, library databases, online articles, citations... it's easy to get lost. What if there was a way to **manage browser tabs efficiently** while researching? There is, and it involves using the **best link preview extension for Chrome** (or your browser of choice).

Imagine you're writing a paper and need to check multiple sources referenced in an article. Instead of opening each one in a new tab, you simply hover:
*   Instantly see the abstract or introduction.
*   Quickly verify if the source is relevant.
*   Keep your main research document open and focused.

This is the power of **previewing links without opening new tabs**.
