# How Do Link Preview Extensions Work? A Deep Dive into the Technology Behind Them

**Link preview extensions** seem almost magical: hover over a link, and *poof*, the content appears without a new tab. But how do they actually work? Let's take a quick dive into the tech.

At its core, a **browser link preview** tool needs to fetch and display content from a linked URL without fully navigating you away or opening a resource-heavy tab. Here's a simplified breakdown:

1.  **Trigger Detection:** The extension constantly listens for trigger events, usually a mouse hover (**link hover preview**) over a hyperlink, but sometimes a click or keyboard shortcut.
2.  **URL Fetching (Lightweight):** When triggered, the extension sends a request to the target URL, similar to how your browser normally would. However, it often requests *only* the essential HTML content, sometimes ignoring heavier elements like complex scripts or large images initially to speed things up.
3.  **Content Extraction & Sanitization:** The fetched HTML is parsed. The extension extracts the main content (text, basic formatting, maybe key images) and often *sanitizes* it, removing potentially harmful scripts or styles to ensure security and prevent the preview from interfering with the current page.
4.  **Display in Overlay:** This cleaned-up content is then injected into a temporary overlay window (often an `iframe` or a `div` element) positioned near the link on your current page. This allows you to **preview links in the current page**.

Extensions like NoTab refine this process, adding features like:
*   **Reader Mode:** Further processing the content for readability.
*   **Caching:** Sometimes storing previews temporarily for faster subsequent views.
*   **Customization:** Allowing users to control trigger methods and preview appearance.

Understanding this helps appreciate how these tools let you **preview websites before opening**, saving time and resources. They cleverly manage web requests and display to offer a seamless **inline link preview**.
